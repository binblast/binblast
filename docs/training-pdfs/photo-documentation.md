# Photo Documentation Standards – REQUIRED

## Why Photos Matter

Photos protect:

- **The company** - Proof of service completion
- **Your pay** - Required for payment processing
- **Customer trust** - Transparency and accountability

## REQUIRED PHOTOS (Exactly 2)

1. **Inside of the bin**
2. **Outside of the bin**

## Inside Photo Guidelines (GOOD)

- Camera angled downward
- Bottom + walls visible
- Clean surface clearly shown
- Good lighting

## Inside Photo (BAD)

- Dark or poorly lit
- Blurry or out of focus
- Partial view only
- Taken before cleaning

## Outside Photo Guidelines (GOOD)

- Entire bin visible
- Sticker visible and readable
- Clean exterior clearly shown
- Bin upright and properly positioned

## Outside Photo (BAD)

- Cropped bin (not fully visible)
- No sticker visible
- Dirty exterior
- Motion blur

## Rules

- **No photos = no payment** for that stop
- Photos must be taken **AFTER cleaning**
- Do not reuse old photos
- Photos must be clear and in focus

## Photo Quality Checklist

Before submitting photos, ensure:

- [ ] Both photos are clear and in focus
- [ ] Inside photo shows clean bottom and walls
